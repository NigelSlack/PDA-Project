# PDA-Project
**GMIT HDip Data Analytics 2019. Programming for Data Analysis project.**  

This project analyses data obtained by the Cairngorm summit weather station in the UK, along with weather data more generally, and produces a simulated dataset for 6 different variables - rainfall, wind speed, temperature, humidity, time of day and day of year.  
The data are examined to determine the types of statistical distribution that best represent them, and for relationships between different variables, and then the Python Numpy.random package is used to generate a realistic set of simulated readings.  

Actual readings come from the automatic weather station run by Heriot-Watt university physics department, and are made available at : http://cairngormweather.eps.hw.ac.uk/index.htm
